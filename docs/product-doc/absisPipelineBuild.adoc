## absisPipelineBuild

This pipeline runs with the CI, after every push (or merge request) to the repository. 

Every git project has configured the integration with the jenkins. One git project one jenkins job. 

Every job works whith a docker machine started with this parameters : "-v /apps/idejen/data:/root/.m2 -v /root/.m2/repository/com/caixabank"

- Every job that run this pipeline use a shared folder '/apps/idejen/data' in order to cache the local repository to avoid download the jars from Nexus all the time.
- In order to avoid conflicts every job use ther own copy of /root/.m2/repository/com/caixabank

All the parameters are supplied by the jenkins integration CI, these are the most importants.

.Continuos Integration Pipeline Parameters
|===
|Name|Description
|GIT_COMMIT|The id of the git event
|GIT_URL|The url of the git project
|gitlabActionType|The action that triggers the continous Integration (PUSH/MERGE), only works with simplePipeline
|===

Other environment variables.

.Environment Variables
|===
|Name|Description
|BUILD_TAG|We use this value to identify the pipeline (GPL needs an unique ID)
|WORKSPACE|The local directory used by the jenkins job
|===

It must be noticed that for some of the following stages, an stage start/update/end event is sent to GPL. This notification is not sent when the event sent by the GitLab webhook is `MERGE`.
This makes sense because once the merge is completed, GitLab will send a `PUSH` webhook event which will be processed on the processed as normal.

If the artifacts arch version is lower than the recomended arch version it will fail with an error.

### Stages

This pipeline has the following stages:

### Next actions

The next actions depend on the origin branch associated with the git lab event.

If the origin branch is:

* **Master** Only a merge can push the code to the master branch
** If the project is a micro the next actions are:
*** Rollback Artifact
*** Create Release Candidate
** Others
*** Create Release Canidate
  
* **Feature** 
** Nothing, the developer only can merge the code to the master branch (via Merge Request)

* **Release**
** If the project is a micro the next actions are:
*** Rollback Artifact
*** Create Release and upgrade the TST environment
*** Create Release and don't upgrade the TST environment
** Others 
*** Create Release and upgrade the TST environment
