## Lifecycle Non micro (Plugin, library or starter)

### Overview

The lifecycle for the libraries (it does not matter if they are architecture or applications) has these steps:

* SNAPSHOTS
* RELEASE-CANDIDATE
* RELEASE

The last step of the lifecycle is the deploy of the release on the nexus.

### Lifecycle details

It began with the feature branch, The developer codes the new feature, the integration continues can deploy to the EDEN environment.

When the developer is satisfied with the new feature can merge this branch to the master.

If the Merge Request is approved and merged, the integration continuos process will build and deploy an SNAPSHOT Artifact of the sample app to the DEV environment.

The developer can develop more features or can promote the version (SNAPSHOT) to the RELASE_CANDIDATE stage. 

With the Creare_Release_Candidate action the job:

* Generates a release branch from the master. The version of the pom will be updated from (X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT) to (X.Y.Z-RC0)
* Updates the SNAPSHOT version from (X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT) to (X.Y+1.0-SNAPSHOT).

The developer can fix the ReleaseCandidate Version, on every push the integration continous will deploy the artifact (sample app) on the TST environment and upgrade from RCX to the RCX+1.

|===
**⚠ Note:** A process will delete all the sample apps installed 45 days ago.

When all the bugs are solved the developer can promote the Release Candidate to a final Release. The job will upgrade from X.Y.Z-RCN to the X.Y.Z and deploy to the PRE environment and optionally to the TST environment.

|===
**⚠ Note:** A process will delete all the sample apps installed two days ago.

The last step with a RELEASE is deploy this artifact to the Nexus like a FINAL RELEASE.


The closing process will make the next steps:

* Notify the final release of the artifact

### Artifact Versioning

The versioning behaviour of those artifacts are from SNAPSHOTS to RELEASE CANDIDATES and RELEASES. the sematic versioning is used.
