## absisPipelineDeploytoPro

This pipeline deploys a micro (architecture o application) to the production environment with the Beta routes, only affects micros not libraries.

It detects if the artifact is the same major or a new major, the previous version is renamed to ancient-XXXX, and the pipeline unmaps the beta route from the ancient.

The new artifact is deployed only with the beta version.

The next step is the cannary process (increasing the percentatge  of requests to the new artifact).
