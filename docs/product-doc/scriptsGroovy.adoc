[#validate-version]
### validate-version

#### Description

Checks the compatibility with previous released versions based on the Swagger contract using https://revapi.org/modules/revapi-maven-plugin/index.html[maven Revapi plugin].

#### Conditional execution
This stage only runs for micro services or data services (`MICRO_APP`).

#### Steps

. *Generate contract pom*
+
The Swagger contract is the single source of truth of a microservice. The compatibility against previous versions needs to be guaranteed before releasing a newer version. In this case, it is only needed to check this compatibility against the classes generated automatically from the Swagger contract, the other classes in the microservice are not considered.
+
For this reason, it is required to generate a separated artifact that only contains these generated classes.
The separated artifact will be used by other services that want to integrate with this service, so from now on it is called the client artifact. The client artifact is generated using a _fake_ pom so the **groupId** can be changed to avoid collisions with the microservice artifact iself.
So the client artifact will have the same groupId as the microservice plus the keyword `.contract`.
+
In this step, the _fake_ pom maven details are fulfilled based on the details of the microservice and both the pom and the Swagger contract are copied into a temporary folder.

. *Install deploy client artifact*
+
In this step, the client artifact is built locally without deploying it to nexus using the maven profile `checkVersion` and the maven goals `clean verify`. This will run the maven Revapi plugin which will search for an artifact with the same groupId and artifactId as the client artifact and the last previously released version to check if there are breaking changes.
+
This is a diagram showing the process:
image::assets/pipeline-validate-version.png[validate-version]

#### Result

If Revapi does not find any breaking change, the stage will end successfully.
If Revapi does find breaking changes, the build will fail.

[#build]
### build

#### Description

Builds the artifact and it deploys it to nexus when branch is not a feature branch.

#### Conditional execution

This stage always runs.

#### Steps

* Scenario: deploy
+
In case the artifact needs to be deployed, for master and release branches only and when not working with a Sample App, the artifact will be deployed in Nexus with maven with the goals `clean deploy`. Once is deployed successfully, the Nexus URL and the buildCode are extracted as they will be needed in a future stage to send this information to the catalog.
+
If the artifact is a Sample App, this will be built with `clean package` goals but it will not be deployed in Nexus.
+
If the branch is other than release or master, then the artifact is only installed in the local repository with `clean install` goals.
* Scenario: no deploy
+
If the artifact is not meant to be deployed, then the artifact is only installed in the local repository.

#### Result

If the build of the artifact does not fail, the stage will end successfully.

[#copy-config-files]
### copy-config-files

#### Description

Copies the config files provided in the `src/main/resource` of the microservice and pushes them to the Config Server Git repository.

#### Conditional execution

This stage runs for microservices that are going to be deployed in Bluemix in any environment except for Eden.

#### Steps

. Clones Config Server Git repository in `config-repo` temp directory accordingly to the environment where the pipeline is deploying.
. Creates if not exists a directory with the spring application name inside `services/apps`.
. Copies all files under `resources` recursively to the directory previously created, maintaining the same folder structure.
. Removes all files not matching `application[^-standalone]*`.
. Commit and push the changes to the Config Server Git repository.
. Delete `config-repo` from local.

### Result

If none of the steps fails, the stage will end successfully.

[#deploy-to-cloud]
### deploy-to-cloud

#### Description

Deploys the artifact to the cloud.

#### Conditional execution

This stage only runs when deployment is required.

#### Steps

.


[#changelog-file]
### changelog-file

#### Description

Generate a file CHANGELOG.md in the repository root once a merge request is launched

#### Conditional execution

Only with user push action, skip the execution when is almuser 
Only if changelog param is activated
Only in feature branch
Only when target branch is master
Only in MERGE actions.

#### Steps

Parse the file if exists.
Check the artifact version (without qualifier) and the user history, retrieving the merge request information
Add the user history (if not exists) in the version that correspond.


[#publish-client]
### publish-client

#### Description

Publishes the client artifacts for alm and alm2 for the microservice.

#### Conditional execution

This stage only runs for micro services or data services (`MICRO_APP`).

#### Steps

. *Cleaning temporary directory*
+
First step is cleaning the source folder in the temporary directory created in the <<validate-version>> stage.

. *Generate contract pom for alm client*
+
It fulfills the _fake_ pom with the maven details of the microservice and copies both the pom and the Swagger contract into the temporary folder. See <<validate-version, validate-version, step 1>> for more details.

. *Install deploy client artifact for alm*
+
Deploys the client artifact for alm in nexus using the _fake_ pom recently copied into the temporary directory, using the maven profile `generateAlmClient` and the goal `deploy`.

. *Generate contract pom for alm2 client*
+
It fulfills the _fake_ pom with the maven details of the microservice and copies both the pom and the Swagger contract to the temporary folder. In this case, not only the groupId changes: the artifactId concats the keyword `Alm2` to the current artifactId. See <<validate-version, validate-version, step 1>> for more details.

. *Install deploy client artifact for alm*
+
Deploys the client artifact for alm2 in nexus using the _fake_ pom recently copied into the temporary directory, using the maven profile `generateAlm2Client` and the goal `deploy`.

#### Result

If there are no failures during the deployment process, the stage will end successfully.

[#publish-artifact-catalog]
### publish-artifact-catalog

#### Description

Publishes the artifact details to the Alm catalog.

#### Conditional execution

This stage runs for every branch that is not a feature branch.

#### Steps

. Calculates all the data to send (list of dependencies, urls for further info, etc)
. Builds and sends the request to catalog

#### Result

If there are no failures sending the request, the stage will end successfully.

[#Generate-archetype-from-project]
### Generate archetype from project

#### Description

This stage builds a maven archetype using a model project provided in the repository. The model can be on the root of the
repository or inside a module folder. The `archetypeModel` property has to be used to provide the path relative to the project root.
This will be used on a maven `archetype:generate` goal to generate the archetype.

The archetype version will match the one present on the model project provided.
An automated modification of the `archetype.properties` file will be done to achieve that.

#### Conditional execution

This stage will only run if the following conditions are true:

* `pipelineData.isPushCI()` is false.
* `isArchetype` is true.
* `archetypeModel` contains a non-empty string, which corresponds to the folder where the model project is.

#### Steps

. Call to `generateArchetypeFromProject` helper function. `archetypeModel` has to be provided.

#### Result

An archetype built on `./{archetypeModel}/temp/{archetypeModel}` folder, relative to the project root, inside
the Docker container.

[#Deploy-archetype-into-Nexus]
### Deploy archetype into Nexus

#### Description

This stage deploys an already-built archetype into Nexus. The archetype is assumed to be on
`{archetypeModel}/target/generated-sources/archetype`, relative to the project root.

#### Conditional execution

This stage will only run if the following conditions are true:

* `pipelineData.isPushCI()` is false.
* `isArchetype` is true.
* `archetypeModel` contains a non-empty string, which corresponds to the folder where the model project is.

We are assuming that the previous stage ran and finished successfully.

#### Steps

. Call to `deployArchetypeIntoNexus` helper function. `archetypeModel` has to be provided.

#### Result

A maven archetype artifact, with versioning according to its `pom.xml` file, will be deployed on Nexus.
