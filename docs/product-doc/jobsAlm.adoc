### job-rollback-artifact

This jobs executes a rollback in the selected environment. It will recover the previous (ancient) artifact and unmap the new route to the affected one.

* *Type:* Declarative Pipeline

* *Build Trigger:* N/A
* *Script:* absisPipelineRollback
* *space affected:* srv_pro (PRO), srv_pre (PRE), srv_tst (TST, EDEN)
* *Parameters:*
  ** pathToRepoParam The url path to the git repo
  ** originBranchParam The origin branch
  ** repoParam The name of the report
  ** artifactTypeParam The type of artifact, it only could be SIMPLE or AGREGADOR, it depends on the kind of project
  ** artifactSubTypeParam The subtype of artifact, it depends on the kind of project
  ** pipelineOrigId The id of the previous pipeline, this parameter only affects to GPL
  ** versionParam This contains the version of the artifact to be deployed in the PRO environment. It only can be RELASE 
  ** environmentParam This contains the affected  environment, we can make a rollback of any artifact deployed in any environment
  ** ignoreExistingAncientParam if true the script doesn't control if the previous artifact is deployed in the selected environment
  ** forceAllCentersParam This contains a boolean that indicates if the script has to "force" the rollback. The false value means that if the rollback fails in the first center, it will abort the execution
  ** artifactParam This contains the id of the artifact
