[#validate-version]
### validate-version

#### Description

Checks the compatibility with previous released versions based on the Swagger contract using https://revapi.org/modules/revapi-maven-plugin/index.html[maven Revapi plugin].

#### Conditional execution
This stage only runs for micro services or data services (`MICRO_APP`).

#### Steps

. *Generate contract pom*
+
The Swagger contract is the single source of truth of a microservice. The compatibility against previous versions needs to be guaranteed before releasing a newer version. In this case, it is only needed to check this compatibility against the classes generated automatically from the Swagger contract, the other classes in the microservice are not considered.
+
For this reason, it is required to generate a separated artifact that only contains these generated classes.
The separated artifact will be used by other services that want to integrate with this service, so from now on it is called the client artifact. The client artifact is generated using a _fake_ pom so the **groupId** can be changed to avoid collisions with the microservice artifact iself.
So the client artifact will have the same groupId as the microservice plus the keyword `.contract`.
+
In this step, the _fake_ pom maven details are fulfilled based on the details of the microservice and both the pom and the Swagger contract are copied into a temporary folder.

. *Install deploy client artifact*
+
In this step, the client artifact is built locally without deploying it to nexus using the maven profile `checkVersion` and the maven goals `clean verify`. This will run the maven Revapi plugin which will search for an artifact with the same groupId and artifactId as the client artifact and the last previously released version to check if there are breaking changes.
+
This is a diagram showing the process:
image::assets/pipeline-validate-version.png[validate-version]

#### Result

If Revapi does not find any breaking change, the stage will end successfully.
If Revapi does find breaking changes, the build will fail.

[#build]

after the execution a dashboard url is saved in pipeline.testData variable in order to sent it to GPL


#### Result

If the code is sent, the stage will end successfully.

[#sonar-quality-gate]
### sonar-quality-gate

#### Result

If the code quality is OK then the stage will end successfully.
If the code quality has issues then the stage will end with pipeline error.
If the code quality has a timeout (10 minutes) the stage will end with pipeline error

[#undeploy-artifact]
### undeploy-artifact

#### Description

[#copy-config-files]
### copy-config-files

#### Description

Copies the config files provided in the `src/main/resource` of the microservice and pushes them to the Config Server Git repository.

#### Conditional execution

This stage runs for microservices that are going to be deployed in Bluemix for the environments of PRE and PRO only.

#### Steps

. Clones Config Server Git repository in `config-repo` temp directory accordingly to the environment where the pipeline is deploying.
. If the artifact is a dataservice, we will do these extra steps:
  . Clones the system repo of the same environment
  . Looks for the systems yaml of the application. The priority is:
    . The same major and app
    . The same app
    . Otherwise it throws an exception, we will do these extra steps.      
  . Generates the app application.yml with the definition of the datasource
. Creates if not exists a directory with the spring application name inside `services/apps`.
  . If the app is a dataservice, we will do these extra steps:
    . Compare the new datasource file against the file generated in the config server, if the file is the same the pipeline will not push the new file.
. Copies all files under `resources` recursively to the directory previously created, maintaining the same folder structure.
. Removes all files not matching `application[^-standalone]*`.
. Commit and push the changes to the Config Server Git repository.
. Delete `config-repo` from local.

### Result

If none of the steps fails, the stage will end successfully.

[#deploy-to-cloud]
### deploy-to-cloud

#### Description

Deploys the artifact to the cloud. The environment is defined by the pipeline.
The process will generate the new manifest will be generated by the process, if the micro is a data-service, the cups of the database credentials will be generated by the pipeline.

[#publish-client]
### publish-client

#### Description

Publishes the client artifacts for absis3 and absis2 for the microservice.

#### Conditional execution

This stage only runs for micro services or data services (`MICRO_APP`).

#### Steps

. *Cleaning temporary directory*
+
First step is cleaning the source folder in the temporary directory created in the <<validate-version>> stage.

. *Generate contract pom for absis3 client*
+
It fulfills the _fake_ pom with the maven details of the microservice and copies both the pom and the Swagger contract into the temporary folder. See <<validate-version, validate-version, step 1>> for more details.

. *Install deploy client artifact for absis3*
+
Deploys the client artifact for absis3 in nexus using the _fake_ pom recently copied into the temporary directory, using the maven profile `generateAbsisClient` and the goal `deploy`.

. *Generate contract pom for absis2 client*
+
It fulfills the _fake_ pom with the maven details of the microservice and copies both the pom and the Swagger contract to the temporary folder. In this case, not only the groupId changes: the artifactId concats the keyword `Absis2` to the current artifactId. See <<validate-version, validate-version, step 1>> for more details.

. *Install deploy client artifact for absis3*
+
Deploys the client artifact for absis2 in nexus using the _fake_ pom recently copied into the temporary directory, using the maven profile `generateAbsis2Client` and the goal `deploy`.

. Builds and sends the request to catalog

#### Result

If there are no failures sending the request, the stage will end successfully.

[#Generate-archetype-from-project]
### Generate archetype from project

#### Description

This stage builds a maven archetype using a model project provided in the repository. The model can be on the root of the
repository or inside a module folder. The `archetypeModel` property has to be used to provide the path relative to the project root.
This will be used on a maven `archetype:generate` goal to generate the archetype.

The archetype version will match the one present on the model project provided.
An automated modification of the `archetype.properties` file will be done to achieve that.

#### Conditional execution

This stage will only run if the following conditions are true:

* `pipelineData.isPushCI()` is false.
* `isArchetype` is true.
* `archetypeModel` contains a non-empty string, which corresponds to the folder where the model project is.

#### Steps

. Call to `generateArchetypeFromProject` helper function. `archetypeModel` has to be provided.

#### Result

An archetype built on `./{archetypeModel}/temp/{archetypeModel}` folder, relative to the project root, inside
the Docker container.

[#Deploy-archetype-into-Nexus]
### Deploy archetype into Nexus

#### Description

This stage deploys an already-built archetype into Nexus. The archetype is assumed to be on
`{archetypeModel}/target/generated-sources/archetype`, relative to the project root.

#### Conditional execution

This stage will only run if the following conditions are true:

* `pipelineData.isPushCI()` is false.
* `isArchetype` is true.
* `archetypeModel` contains a non-empty string, which corresponds to the folder where the model project is.

We are assuming that the previous stage ran and finished successfully.

### Result

[#publish-documentation]
### publish-documentation

#### Description

This stage publishes the documentation of each artifact into a GIT repository.

#### Conditional execution

This stage always run.

#### Steps

This stage executes the following steps:

- Check out the repository **services-catalog** where all the documentation is stored.
- Calculates the path to the folder in the repo depending on if it is an application or an architecture artifact. The format of the path is:
   `services/[arch|apps]/<artifactName>/v<majorVersion>/<version>`
+
Where `version` contains `SNAPSHOT` when the CI build runs in the branch _master_. Otherwise is always the version of the pom.xml without the qualifier.
- Based on the pipeline and the type of artifact it is decided which documentation is copied:
   - Pipeline is CI: only contract would be copied in case the application is a Micro App or Micro Arch.
   - Pipeline is createRelease and artifact is Micro App: product documentation, static content and contract.
   - - Pipeline is createRelease and artifact is Micro Arch: product documentation and static content.
   - - Pipeline is createRelease and artifact is other: product documentation.
- Copy the documentation
- If the artifact belongs to architecture, then it generates an `index.md` at the _artifactName_ folder level, with the reference to every version and another one in the version folder to link to each content.
- Commit and push the new files to the `services-catalog` repository.

#### Result

If none of the above mentioned steps fails, the stage will end successfully.


[#validate-dependencies-version]
### validate-dependencies-version

#### Description

Validates the version of the parent pom, dependencies and plugins defined in the pom.xml file based on:

- Artifacts with a RC version cannot have SNAPSHOT dependencies.
- Artifacts with a released or final version cannot have SNAPSHOT or RC dependencies.

#### Conditional execution

This stage always runs.

#### Steps

1. If the pipeline is CI, it only runs when the branch is release. Then, it checks if there is any SNAPSHOT dependency defined in the **pom.xml**. If so, it throws an error and the pipeline fails.
2. If the pipeline is CreateRC, it checks if there is any SNAPSHOT dependency defined in the **pom.xml**. If so, it throws an error and the pipeline fails.
3. If the pipeline is CreateRelease, it checks if there is any SNAPSHOT or RC dependency defined in the `pom.xml`. If so, it throws an error and the pipeline fails.

#### Result

If the dependencies are OK, the stage will end up successfully but if the dependencies are not correct, it will throw an error. The error will print out which are the incorrect versions found in the **pom.xml**.
