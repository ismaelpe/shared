### Stages

It is not a declarative pipeline, then it doesn't have any stage.

Basically, the behavior differs if the company is caixabank or bpi and the type of artifact (application or architecture).

* Company BPI, the job creates
** domain a folder with the domain name
** module a folder with the module/app
** job the name of the repo (declarative pipeline)
* Company CBK, the job creates
** domain a folder with the domain name
** job the name of the repo (declarative pipeline)

Depending the type of artifact

* Application
** SRV.LIB The job created 
*** /apps/common/<domain>/<module>/<nameApp> (BPI)
*** /apps/common/<domain>/<nameApp> (CBK)
** SRV.MS The job created
*** /apps/service/<domain>/<module>/<nameApp> (BPI)
*** /apps/service/<domain>/<nameApp> (CBK)
** SRV.DS
*** /apps/data-service/<domain>/<module>/<nameApp> (BPI)
*** /apps/data-service/<domain>/<nameApp> (CBK)

* Architecture
*** /arch/<domain>/<nameApp> (BPI/CBK)
