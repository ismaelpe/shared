## absisPipelineCreateRC

This pipeline runs manually when a new Release Candidate has to be created. 

The job will create a new release branch with the code of the new Release Candidate. The job sets the Version to the RC0 of the artifact, and increase the master to the next minor.

NOTE: For example if the master has the 1.6.0-SNASHOT the next RC will be 1.6.0-RC0 and the master will increase to the 1.7.0-SNAPSHOT
