# customPipelineCicsWsdlBuild

## Overview

This document describes the `customPipelineCicsWsdlBuild`, which is a custom pipeline (thus not following the standard lifecycle defined by `almPipelineBuild`)
meant to built transaction-oriented CICS clients. Those clients are built as Spring Boot starters.

This pipeline is fired by the project `cics-wsdl` via a direct call on its `Jenkinsfile`.
The GitLab repository needs to have Jenkins CI integration enabled.

There are three entities involved in this pipeline execution:

* The `cics-wsdl` project itself, which is a container for the WSDLs describing the services the clients are to communicate to.
There is a single WSDL for each type and transaction.
* Maven archetypes of the form `cics-{type}-spring-boot-starter-archetype`. Available types at the moment are:
** normal
** proxy
** link
* CICS clients in the form of Spring Boot starters. Those clients have the form `cics-{type}-{txNumber}-spring-boot-starter`
and are based on the respective `{type}` archetype. Each archetype is used to build a ready-to-use client for each transaction to CICS, referenced by `{txNumber}`.


## Lifecycle Management

### Overview

The maven archetype for each CICS transaction type is built by the pipeline `almPipelineBuild` which uses the maven
goal `archetype:create-from-project`. Those projects follow the standard lifecycle described in the aforementioned pipeline.

The project `almPipelineBuild` uses to generate the archetype is a client implementation for each type of transaction on the form of an Spring Boot starter,
plus a sample app. Those two artifacts are bundled together in a multi-module project. For example:

* `cics-normal-starter`
* `cics-proxy-starter`
* `cics-link-starter`

When deploying on Nexus, only the Spring Boot starter project is used. The sample app is ignored.

Once those archetypes are on Nexus. WSDLs can be added or modified on the `cics-wsdl` project.
When those modifications are pushed to a branch, `customPipelineCicsWsdlBuild` will be fired via the GitLab -- Jenkins
integration and the `Jenkinsfile` present on `cics-wsdl`.

The pipeline will check which WSDL has been added or modified, therefore knowing the type and transaction a client has
to be generated for. The maven goal `archetype:generate` will then be used to generate a new client for that given type
and transaction. Once created, this client will be deployed on Nexus.

|===
**⚠ Note:** A **single** WSDL addition/modification is currently supported. If more than one are present, only the first present on the changelog will be processed.

### Lifecycle details

The lifecycle for both archetypes and starters has to begin with a `cics-wsdl` artifact already present on Nexus.
This artifact can be an SNAPSHOT, but must contain a valid WSDL corresponding to the type and transaction
that are used as model in the archetype model project. There is one project of each transaction type.

Examples are:

* `cics-normal-starter` contains the model for transaction H451, so `txH451.wsdl` has to be present in the
Nexus-deployed `cics-wsdl` artifact.
* `cics-proxy-starter` contains the model for transaction 5120, so `tx5120.wsdl` is needed.
* `cics-link-starter` is yet to be built.

Each of those projects has an `archetype.properties` file, which at the same time, defines the required property `txNumber`.
This property is used to name packages, classes and WSDL references, among other things, and it will be different
for each transaction.

As mentioned, `almPipelineBuild` is controlling the lifecycle of those archetype models, being SNAPSHOTs, Release Candidates
or final releases, depending of the context they are built.
Thus, the archetype versions deployed on Nexus will match those in the models.

When a commit is pushed to the `cics-wsdl` repository, the pipeline will follow those steps:

1. Build a new `cics-wsdl` with the updates and deploy it into Nexus.

2. Then, it will look for the latest version of the corresponding archetype, depending of which type the new/modified WSDL was.
* The following hierarchy will be followed:
** Final releases (no suffix)
** Release candidates
** Milestone releases
** SNAPSHOT releases
** Deprecated releases

3. The mvn goal `archetype:generate` will be invoked to have the client generated as an Spring Boot starter. An example of a
generated client may be `cics-normal-txH451-spring-boot-starter`.

4. The artifact is published on the Alm Catalog and on Nexus, making it ready to use.

### Artifact versioning

#### `cics-{type}-starter` and `cics-{type}-spring-boot-starter-archetype`

As mentioned above, those projects follow the lifecycle defined by the `almPipelineBuild` pipeline so the corresponding archetypes will do so too.
When a Release Candidate or a Release is built using the jenkins job defined to do so, an archetype will be released using `-RCx`-suffixed or
final versions respectively.

#### `cics-wsdl`

This artifact is only versioned when changes are pushed into the `master` branch. On those cases, the latest release present on Nexus will
be retrieved and its minor version increased in one. This version would be then used to deploy the new artifact on Nexus.
Only final releases are considered. SNAPSHOT, Release Candidates, Milestones and deprecated artifacts are ignored.

#### `cics-{type}-spring-boot-starter`

The versioning behaviour of those artifacts are the same as `cics-wsdl`. Automatic versioning for SNAPSHOTs or any kind of version
different to final are **not** supported at the moment.

|===
**⚠ Note:** If no final version of `cics-wsdl` is present on Nexus. The default `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` will be used.
If not present the build will fail.
