## Lifecycle Micro

### Overview

The lifecycle for the micros (it does not matter if they are architecture or applications) has these steps:

* SNAPSHOTS
* RELEASE-CANDIDATE
* RELEASE

The last step of the lifecycle is the deploy on the production environment.

### Lifecycle details

It began with the feature branch, The developer codes the new feature and pushes to the  git branch. The integration continues can deploy (optionally) to the EDEN environment.

When the developer is satisfied with the new feature can merge this branch to the master.

If the Merge Request is approved and merged, the integration continuos process will build and deploy an SNAPSHOT Artifact to the DEV environment.

The developer can develop more features or can promote the version (SNAPSHOT) to the RELASE_CANDIDATE stage. 

With the Creare_Release_Candidate action the job:

* Generates a release branch from the master. The version of the pom will be updated from (X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT) to (X.Y.Z-RC0)
* Updates the SNAPSHOT version from (X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT) to (X.Y+1.0-SNAPSHOT).

The developer can fix the ReleaseCandidate Version, on every push the integration continous will deploy the artifact on the TST environment and upgrade from RCX to the RCX+1.

When all the bugs are solved the developer can promote the Release Candidate to a final Release. The job will upgrade from X.Y.Z-RCN to the X.Y.Z and deploy to the PRE environment and optionally to the TST environment.

The next step with a RELEASE is deploy this artifact to the PRO production.

If the artifact is a minor of an existing artifact the deploy-to-pro will deploy the micro with a beta route and begin the cannary process.
If the artifact is a new major or a new artifact the deploy-to-pro will deploy the micro with a beta route and prepare the release for the closing process.

The closing process will make the next steps:

* Route the micro to the official routes.
* If the artifact is a minor of an existing artifact (ancient), unmap the official routes from the ancient and stop this application (The ancient will remain for the rollback process).

### Artifact Versioning

The versioning behaviour of those artifacts are from SNAPSHOTS to RELEASE CANDIDATES and RELEASES. the sematic versioning is used.

A minor artifact replaces the last minor of the same major. In the lifecycle of an application micro the process will include a verify stage with the api contract to ensure that the restrictions of the semantic versioning are respected. 

If the revapi control fails it means that the new version of the contract needs a new major, because will affect current consumers.
